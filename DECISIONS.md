# 💡 Design Decisions

## 📦 State Management
Chose `Provider` for its simplicity and integration with Flutter's reactive model.

## 🌐 Networking
Using the `http` package due to its ease of use and simplicity for small to medium apps.

## 📂 Folder Structure
Adopted a scalable structure:
- `models/`
- `screens/`
- `providers/`
- `data/`
