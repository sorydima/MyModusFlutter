## Bot service (FastAPI) â€” quickstart

The repository now includes a bot service (bot_service/) that provides:
- FastAPI endpoints to enqueue scraping tasks (`POST /enqueue`)
- A worker (`worker.py`) that polls the sqlite DB and processes jobs
- A simple requests-based scraper (`scraper_requests.py`) and an optional Playwright scraper (`scraper_playwright.py`)

Local dev steps:
1. Create virtualenv and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r bot_service/requirements.txt
   ```
2. Optionally install Playwright browsers if you plan to use the Playwright scraper:
   ```bash
   playwright install chromium
   ```
3. Initialize DB:
   ```bash
   python bot_service/init_db.py
   ```
4. Start API server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn bot_service.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
   ```
5. Start worker in another shell:
   ```bash
   python bot_service/worker.py
   ```

To enqueue a job:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/enqueue -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url":"https://www.wildberries.ru/catalog/12345", "connector":"wildberries"}'
```

Notes:
- For many marketplace pages you'll need Playwright (JS-rendered pages). The requests-based scraper works on simple static pages.
- Respect robots.txt and marketplace ToS. Use polite delays, proxy rotation and don't overload target sites.
